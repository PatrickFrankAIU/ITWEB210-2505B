Purpose

The purpose of this assignment is for you to demonstrate the ability to create a website, which shows that you can develop and maintain an application that builds pages on command.

Assignment Instructions

For this assignment, you will access your local machine or Glitch to create a web page.

Create a website using Visual Studio Code based on the following requirements. The theme of this page can be any topic that you would feel comfortable presenting to a recruiter or employer. (Note that the goal here is not a creative visual presentation, but simply demonstrating HTML features.)

Create a page file named “contact.html” that includes the standard HTML document structure (remember the Control-Space bar trick from Module 1).
In the page body, create the following sections:
✓ A Header containing the text “Contact Form”.
✓ A Footer containing the text “Copyright 2023”.
✓ A Form between the Header and Footer containing the details listed below.
✓ Within the Form tag, set the Action attribute to empty (“”) and set the Method attribute to “POST”.
In the Form section, create the following features using HTML Form tags:
✓ Text inputs named Name, City and Zip Code.
✓ Placeholder text for each of the text inputs, and no Value attribute present.
✓ Unique ID values for each of the text inputs.
✓ A Checkbox with the Name attribute set to “Confirmed” and the ID attribute set to “Waiver”.
✓ A Label before the Checkbox with the For attribute set to “Waiver” and displaying the text “Disclaimer acknowledgement.”
✓ A Drop-down control using the Select tag, with four options of your choice and appropriate display text for a contact form.
✓ A Text Area with the name set to “Details”, with 5 rows and 60 columns and Placeholder set to “Please type your request here.”
✓ A submit button with the Value attribute set to “Send”.
