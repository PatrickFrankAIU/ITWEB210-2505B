Objective: Construct an HTML form that allows potential guests to book their stay at a boutique hotel. The form should collect personal information, accommodation preferences, dates of stay, and any special requests.

Requirements:

Guest Information:
Include fields for the guest's name. This field is essential for personalizing the guest's stay and should be marked as required.

Dates of Stay:
Provide input fields for guests to select their check-in and check-out dates. Use the type="date" input to ensure users can easily select dates. Both fields should be required to avoid incomplete bookings.

Room Type Selection:
Implement a dropdown list <select> that allows guests to choose the type of room they wish to book. Options should include "Single", "Double", and "Suite".

Special Requests:
Add a textarea field for guests to enter any special requests they might have for their stay (e.g., late check-in, high floor preference). While this field offers customization for the guest's stay, it should not be marked as required, allowing for optional input.

Estimated Arrival Time:
Include a field where guests can indicate their estimated time of arrival using type="time". This information can help the hotel better prepare for guest arrivals.

Submission:
Provide a submit button labeled "Book Now" to finalize the booking process.

Tips:

Ensure each input field is accompanied by an appropriate , enhancing form accessibility and usability. The for attribute of the label should match the id of the corresponding input field.
Use the required attribute on essential fields (guest name, check-in and check-out dates, room type) to ensure the form collects all necessary information for the booking.
The name attribute on each form element is crucial for identifying form data upon submission.
Consider the form's layout and how each element contributes to a seamless user experience. Guide users with clear instructions or placeholder text where applicable.
Deliverables:
Craft an HTML document that features the booking form described. The form should be intuitive and user-friendly, structured to capture all pertinent details for a guest's stay at the boutique hotel. While the backend processing of the form is not required for this exercise, the form should be complete and ready for user interaction.
